# Pyduino
pyduino is a python module that help to make arduino code using python

-LIGHT ON A LED:

    Fonction: __on__(pin)
    Argument: 
            pin: The number of the digital pin
    As a output this function will turn on the led.
    You can see the exemple in the file example.py (Example1:turn on a led)
    
-SWITCH OFF A LED:

    Fonction: __off__(pin)
    Argument: 
            pin: The number of the digital pin
    As a output this function will turn on the led.
    An example is provide in the file example.py(Example2: blink a LED)
   
   
 -SWITCH BUTTON:
 
    Fonction: __switch__(pin)
    Argument: 
            pin The number of the digital pin
    As a output this function will return the switchstate (1 if if the button is pressed or 0 otherwise).
    An example is provide in the file example.py(Example3: Control 2 LED using a switch button.
